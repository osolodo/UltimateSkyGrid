# UltimateSkyGrid

Resurrected for Minecraft 1.17 and the Spigot framework

* SourceCode for this plugin: https://github.com/osolodo/UltimateSkyGrid
* The Bukkit page of the original plugin:
http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ultimate-skygrid/pages/main/source/

This resurrected version does some things differently to the original plugin it is based on:

1. There are no commands or permissions included in this plugin. Only a world generator. It is designed for and tested
   with Multiverse2.
2. The config file, and some internal logic has changed from the original. I like it better this way and may change it
   more in the future. I won't promise backwards compatibility, but I will strive to make it more readable and more
   configurable with less work for the user.
3. Although the description says it's for the Spigot framework I've only tested it on PaperMC. If you don't use PaperMC
   but want to use this plugin, give it a try, let me know how it works out, I'll consider adding support when there is
   demand.
4. This is a personal project, done in my weekends to familiarise myself with minecraft generators and for the enjoyment
   of my friends. If you find a bug or have a feature request make an issue on the github project. If you don't like my
   response or want it addressed sooner, that's why it's open source, go nuts.
